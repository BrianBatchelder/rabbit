# Welcome to the Rabbit project!
Rabbit uses your iPhone to track your pace, and our own custom wristband to show you at a glance if you are running below, at or above pace.

We recommend using the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) process for working in this repo. The Atlassian tool, [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is an excellent tool for working with Git and [fully supports Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
